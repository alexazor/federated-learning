IMT Atlantique research project on federated learning.

This was a school project inspired from the blog post [Distributed machine learning and partially homomorphic encryption](https://giorgiop.github.io/posts/2017/07/13/distributed-machine-learning-and-partially-homomorphic-encryption-1/) written by Giogio Patrini.
